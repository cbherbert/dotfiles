# dotfiles

This repository is maintained mostly for my personal convenience; it contains the configuration files of my usual setup, and in particular:

	* bash
	* emacs
	* python

This configuration is used in a scientific computing context (numerical simulations and data analysis using C,C++,Fortran and Python), and is designed to work, as much as possible, on different platforms, from the workstation to the cluster. It is tested under both OS X and several Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu,...)

There is probably nothing particularly rare here, and many things are actually inspired from other publicly available repositories, but feel free to use anything you might find interesting.
Of course these files are not intended for general use but are only tailored to fit my particular needs and use case, so they should not be expected to work out-of-the-box.
